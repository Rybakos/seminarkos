          <h1>Big Bang</h1>
          <p>
            The Big Bang is the prevailing scientific theory that describes the
            origin and early development of the universe. According to this
            theory, the universe began as an extremely hot and dense point,
            often referred to as a singularity, around 13.8 billion years ago.
            The Big Bang marks the starting point of cosmic evolution, giving
            rise to the vast expanse of space and time as we know it.
          </p>
          <h3 class="">An Infinitely Dense Singularity</h3>
          <p>
            Prior to the Big Bang, the entire universe existed in a state of
            unimaginable density and temperature. All matter, energy, and the
            fabric of space itself were concentrated into an infinitesimally
            small point known as a singularity. At this point, the laws of
            physics as we understand them today cease to hold, and the universe
            was governed by conditions far beyond our current comprehension.
          </p>
          <h3>A Rapid Expansion</h3>
          <p>
            In a fraction of a second, the singularity underwent a rapid
            expansion event known as cosmic inflation. This expansion caused
            space to stretch and expand at an incredible rate, creating an
            expanding universe. As space expanded, it carried matter and energy
            with it, setting the stage for the formation of galaxies, stars, and
            all the cosmic structures we observe today.
          </p>
          <h3>Formation of Fundamental Particles</h3>
          <p>
            During the early moments of the universe, as it cooled down from its
            initial state, fundamental particles began to form. Quarks, which
            are elementary particles that make up protons and neutrons, came
            into existence. In the extreme heat of the early universe, quarks
            were free and existed in a quark-gluon plasma state. As the universe
            continued to cool, the quarks combined and formed protons and
            neutrons, which then went on to become the building blocks of atomic
            nuclei. These atomic nuclei later captured electrons to form
            complete atoms, such as hydrogen and helium, which were the
            predominant elements during the early stages of the universe.
          </p>
          <h3>Cosmic Background Radiation</h3>
          <p>
            As the universe expanded and cooled further, a significant event
            occurred known as recombination. This event happened when the
            universe had cooled enough for electrons to combine with atomic
            nuclei, forming neutral atoms. This allowed photons to travel freely
            without constant interaction with charged particles. The release of
            these photons marked the beginning of the cosmic microwave
            background radiation, a faint glow that permeates the entire
            universe and provides crucial evidence supporting the Big Bang
            theory.
          </p>
          <h3>The Road to Cosmic Evolution</h3>
          <p>
            Following the initial expansion, matter and energy continued to
            evolve and come together under the influence of gravity. Over time,
            regions of higher density formed, giving rise to the formation of
            galaxies, galaxy clusters, and superclusters. Within these
            structures, the gravitational pull of matter led to the formation of
            stars, planets, and other celestial bodies, including our own Solar
            System. The Big Bang theory provides a comprehensive framework for
            understanding the origin, expansion, and development of the
            universe. It is supported by a wide range of observational evidence,
            such as the cosmic microwave background radiation, the abundance of
            light elements, and the observed redshift of galaxies. While many
            questions about the early moments of the universe remain, ongoing
            research and observations continue to deepen our understanding of
            this extraordinary event.
